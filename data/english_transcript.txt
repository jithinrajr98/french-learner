2. Welcome to Tallback GP.  
3. We are happy to debrief the German Grand Prix.  
4. Marc Marquez won the race.  
5. There is still much to discuss.  
6. First, we thank our partners.  
7. Our partners are FM insurance and Motule.  
8. [Music plays].  
9. [Applause].  
10. Let’s start the debrief.  
11. I am joined by Thomas Morcellino.  
12. Hi, Thomas.  
13. Hi, Rick.  
14. Thomas is always traveling.  
15. He is in Saxony or Germany now.  
16. Michel Turco is also here.  
17. Good evening, Michel.  
18. Hi, everyone.  
19. Sorry for the hotel room background.  
20. The curtains are not nice.  
21. But I am nearby.  
22. This is where Michel stayed.  
23. We understand.  
24. Now, let’s talk about Marc Marquez.  
25. He was the star of the race.  
26. Thomas, tell us about his stats.  
27. This was his 69th MotoGP win.  
28. He passed Agostini’s record.  
29. It was his 200th race start.  
30. His brother also had his 100th start.  
31. The numbers aligned perfectly.  
32. He won for the 9th time at Saxon Ring.  
33. He is second in most wins at one track.  
34. Only Agostini has more at Imatra.  
35. One more win will tie the record.  
36. Michel, was his victory expected?  
37. Yes, no one doubted him.  
38. He was smart in practice.  
39. He used medium tires, not soft.  
40. He prepared for the race conditions.  
41. It worked perfectly.  
42. Thomas, another interesting fact.  
43. Since 2010, he wins every German GP.  
44. Except last year, he was second.  
45. In 2022, he crashed before the race.  
46. In 2023, he withdrew in warmup.  
47. No race in 2020-21 due to COVID.  
48. But otherwise, he always wins here.  
49. This track suits him perfectly.  
50. It has 10 left turns and 3 right turns.  
51. His knee sliders are special here.  
52. He uses a thicker slider on the right.  
53. It helps with support.  
54. No one can beat him here.  
55. He leads by 83 points now.  
56. The next race is at a new track.  
57. But he will likely keep winning.  
58. The press room is betting on his title.  
59. He stays cautious, though.  
60. He says he stays focused.  
61. Mistakes happen when he loses concentration.  
62. Michel, did he say anything else?  
63. He joked a little but stayed serious.
