1. Today, I’m going to show you how some restaurants manipulate the bills of foreign tourists in Paris.  
2. We’ll pretend to be American tourists to test these scams.  
3. For our tourist look, we wore a typical T-shirt, a cap, and sunglasses.  
4. American tourists complain about inflated bills in Parisian restaurants.  
5. Some restaurants charge more for items than the price shown on the menu.  
6. Others pressure tourists into leaving a tip by saying service isn’t included.  
7. In the U.S., servers rely heavily on tips, unlike in France.  
8. We tested these practices in a very touristy area of Paris.  
9. We invited Marc, an expert in scams, to join us.  
10. We entered the restaurant separately to avoid suspicion.  
11. Marc was given a free carafe of water, while I was served a €6 bottle.  
12. For the Coke, Marc got a 33cl can, while I was given a pint for €9.50.  
13. The difference between our bills was almost €10 for the same order.  
14. Restaurants take advantage of tourists’ fatigue and lack of familiarity.  
15. In the U.S., large drink sizes are common, which justifies abusive pricing here.  
16. At another restaurant, the waiter suggested a tip and added it directly to my card.  
17. I paid €32 instead of €28 due to a forced 15% tip.  
18. Once again, I was charged €6 for bottled water instead of getting a free carafe.  
19. Some servers lie by saying service isn’t included in France.  
20. These practices aren’t systematic, but they exist.  
21. We interviewed Franck Trouet, director of France’s hospitality and restaurant association.  
22. He called these practices "scams" and "a disgrace to the profession."  
23. In France, table settings, water, and bread are free.  
24. Customers have the right to refuse paid bottled water.  
25. Tipping is not mandatory and should remain voluntary.  
26. Payment terminals suggesting digital tips have confused tourists.  
27. In France, leaving a 10–20% tip like in the U.S. is rare.  
28. I asked the waiter why I was charged for water, but his answer was evasive.  
29. We asked American tourists if they knew the rules in France.  
30. Many don’t realize they can ask for free tap water.  
31. Some still believe they have to pay for water in France.  
32. Others leave tips out of habit, even if they know it’s not required.  
33. Americans are surprised to learn water is free in French restaurants.  
34. These scams mostly target tourists unfamiliar with local customs.  
35. Asking for a "carafe of water" is a good way to avoid overcharging.  
36. Dishonest servers exploit the language barrier.  
37. Displayed prices must be respected—otherwise, it’s fraud.  
38. Tourists should check their bills before paying.  
39. Some restaurants exploit Americans’ expectations about tipping.  
40. Cultural differences partly explain these misunderstandings.  
41. Customers have the right to dispute an unfair bill.  
42. Industry professionals condemn these fraudulent practices.  
43. Tips in France are a bonus, not an obligation.  
44. Servers who force tips harm the image of French dining.  
45. Tourists should be informed of their rights to avoid scams.  
46. Paid bottled water shouldn’t be imposed without consent.  
47. Honest restaurants always clarify free options.  
48. Online reviews can help spot shady establishments.  
49. This investigation shows the importance of consumer vigilance.  
50. In short: Ask for tap water and remember—tipping is optional!
